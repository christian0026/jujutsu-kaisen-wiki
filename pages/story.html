                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p>In a world where negative emotions manifest as Curses, specially trained sorcerers fight to protect humanity. Follow the journey of Yuji Itadori as he enters the dangerous realm of Jujutsu sorcery.</p>

                    <h3>CURSE ARC</h3>
                    <p>Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living a normal life until he encounters his school's Occult Club in possession of a cursed object - a rotting finger. When the finger attracts dangerous curses to the school, Yuji swallows it to protect his friends, becoming the vessel for Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses.</p>
                    <p>Megumi Fushiguro, a young jujutsu sorcerer who was tracking the finger, witnesses Yuji's actions. Despite becoming possessed, Yuji maintains control of his body. This leads to a death sentence being postponed by Satoru Gojo, who convinces the jujutsu higher-ups to let Yuji live until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers, so the curse can be eliminated once and for all.</p>

                    <p>During one of their missions in a juvenile detention center, they encounter their first Special Grade curse, which tests their newly formed teamwork. Through these trials, the bonds between the first-year students grow stronger as they face the darker realities of the jujutsu world.</p>

                    <p>The first-year students face Mahito, a powerful and sadistic Special Grade curse who can manipulate souls with his Idle Transfiguration technique. During this confrontation, Yuji experiences profound loss when Junpei Yoshino, a troubled teen he befriended, is killed by Mahito.</p>
                    <p>This arc introduces the viewer to the main antagonistic curses — Mahito, Jogo, Hanami, and Choso — who are plotting something sinister under the guidance of a mysterious figure who resembles Suguru Geto, Gojo's former best friend turned curse user.</p>

                    <p>During this arc, Yuji forms an unlikely friendship with Aoi Todo from Kyoto, who helps him better control his cursed energy. The students must set aside their rivalries to defend against the curse attack, showcasing their growth and abilities.</p>

The most powerful of these brothers, Choso, challenges Yuji in a fierce battle, believing him to be responsible for his siblings' deaths.</p>
                    <p>This arc explores the gray morality of the jujutsu world, as the Death Paintings, while dangerous, have human emotions and familial bonds. It also introduces important plot elements that become significant in later arcs.</p>
